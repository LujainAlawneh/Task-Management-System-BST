**Task Management System (BST)**

This project is a task management system written in C.
It uses a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to store and manage tasks.

The project was done for the course **COMP2421 (Data Structures)**.

The program allows the user to:
- Load tasks from a file
- Add a new task
- Delete a task
- Search for a task by name
- Mark a task as performed
- View performed and unperformed tasks
- Restructure the BST using different task attributes
- Display information about the tree (height, size, etc.)

**Input file:**
The input file must be named `tasks.txt`.
Each line in the file has this format:
`TaskID#TaskName#Date#Duration`

Example:
`101#study COMP2421#24/3/2025#3.5`

**How to run:**
Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:
`gcc P2_1230127_LujainAlawneh_sec4.c -o task_manager`
Then run:
`./task_manager`
